# -Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-VGG16
Developed a robust Lung Cancer Detection system utilizing transfer learning with the VGG16 model to classify lung cancer cases from CT scan images. The project leverages the IQOTHNCCD Lung Cancer dataset to train the model, enhancing its ability to accurately differentiate between malignant, benign, and normal cases.
